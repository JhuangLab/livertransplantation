## Multi-Omics Biomarker Discovery for Acute Cellular Rejection in Liver Transplantation

Liver transplantation (LT) is the definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, acute cellular rejection (ACR) remains a leading cause of early graft dysfunction. The current diagnostic standard—percutaneous liver biopsy—is invasive, prone to sampling error, and unsuitable for frequent monitoring, highlighting the urgent need for non-invasive biomarkers.

Recent advances in omics technologies have enabled the discovery of potential protein and metabolite signatures associated with graft rejection and post-transplant complications. Yet, most existing studies are cross-sectional and rely on a single omics layer, limiting their clinical utility for dynamic monitoring.

### Study Objective

This retrospective study aims to address these limitations by: - Identifying a **plasma-based diagnostic biomarker combination** to detect acute cellular rejection. - Developing a **treatment-response biomarker combination** to evaluate the efficacy of anti-rejection therapy.

We applied a stringent, multi-algorithm consistent feature selection strategy on a well-curated cohort to ensure robust biomarker identification.

### Key Features

-   Integration of **proteomic and metabolomic data**
-   Focus on both **diagnosis** and **therapeutic response**
-   Use of **longitudinal sampling** to capture dynamic immune changes
-   Rigorous **feature selection pipeline** for enhanced reproducibility
