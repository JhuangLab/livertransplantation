### Integrated Plasma Proteomic and Metabolomic Signatures for Non-Invasive Diagnosis and Therapeutic Monitoring of Acute Rejection after Liver Transplantation

Liver transplantation is the most promising strategy to solve the global shortage of donor livers. Although recent pig-to-human heart, kidney, and auxiliary liver transplants have proven surgical feasibility, coagulation dysregulation remains the major obstacle to long-term survival.

Here we performed orthotopic liver transplantation from our specific pathogen-free (SPF) **10-gene-edited** pig (GTKO/CMAHKO/β4GalNT2KO + hCD46/hCD55/hCD59/hTBM/hCD39/hEPCR/hCD47) into a Tibetan macaque. The graft showed immediate function (bile production within minutes) but the recipient rapidly developed severe consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, fibrinogen depletion, PT/INR prolongation, and marked reduction of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) within 24 h.


These data reveal that, despite extensive genetic engineering, the principal early barriers in porcine-to-primate liver transplantation are **macrophage-driven innate immunity** and **systemic coagulation exhaustion** via the complement–coagulation axis.
